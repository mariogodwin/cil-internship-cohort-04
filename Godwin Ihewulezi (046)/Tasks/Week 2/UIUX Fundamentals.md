## WHAT IS UI/ UX DESIGN? 

Whether it is for designing a website, an app, a web form, or another kind of interactive interface, stellar UI design is crucial to your success. This is because it is the link between users and websites or web applications. Without a superb UI design, users are not going to stick around. 

Without the basic design elements that help users intuitively navigate your site, understand the value of your service or products, and make decisions, you are at a huge disadvantage over your competitors. The best interface designs are simple, consistent, invisible, and empower users.

## PRINCIPLES OF UI/UX 

UX design is a creative and ever-changing field that welcomes fresh ideas from new practitioners, but there are some foundational UX design principles that every new designer should understand.

* **Meet the users’ needs:** The foremost of all UX design principles is to focus on users throughout the design process. The term user experience itself makes it clear that your work needs to center on improving your users’ experience with your product or service.

* **Know where you are in the design process:** For new UX designers who are only just testing the internship waters or are in junior positions, the design process can be overwhelming. A lot of work goes into designing, so knowing your place in the process is significant in several ways.

* **Have a clear hierarchy:** It is easy to take hierarchy for granted, but it is a UX principle that ensures smooth navigation throughout a design. There are two chief hierarchies that you need to note. First comes the hierarchy that is associated with how content or information is organized throughout the design.

* **Keep it consistent:** Users expect products to share some similarities with other products they regularly use. This makes it easy for them to become familiar with the new product without any additional learning costs. It may sound a little counterintuitive, but the more familiar your design is to others, the faster users can learn to use it, which enhances their experience.

* **Understand accessibility:** An increasingly important rule from among the UX design basics is designing with accessibility in mind. In simple words, a designer’s responsibility is to make sure their design is usable for as many people as possible. This means that your design needs to be accessible to people with disabilities too.

* **Context is key:** When designing, you need to take into account the user’s context. Location is a commonly understood contextual factor—are you designing for someone on the go or for someone sitting at a desk? But there are other things to consider, including the time available with the user, their emotional state, the device they are using, the people who influence them, and more.

* **Usability first:** UX design is entirely focused on solving the users’ problems, which makes the usability of the design one of the most crucial user experience design principles. No matter how aesthetically pleasing your work may be, it won’t strike a chord with the user unless it is safe and easy to use.

* **Less is more:** The less-is-more design principle was originally proposed by the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. For UX, the underlying aim of this is simple: reducing the operational and cognitive costs of the users. In placing value on this, the design’s usability and consistency improve.

* **Use simple language:** Just as simplicity has become a best practice in visual design, UX-focused copywriting should avoid technical terms and opt for simple language. Users are busy, they’re on the go, and they’re multi-tasking, so use words in your design that are closest to the user’s thoughts.

* **Typography is powerful:** Equally important to the words you use in your design is typography. The author of “The Elements of Typographic Style,” Robert Bringhurst, highlights the role of this UX design principle well. He writes, “Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form.”

* **Feedback matters:** Design should be interactive by nature. So, when a user clicks on something, they will need a response from the product to understand that their command has been received. Feedback is a crucial way to encourage communication between humans and machines.

* **Confirm before you commit:** Accidents happen all the time. One common digital example: a person may unintentionally place an order. (How many parents have had to ask for refunds after their young kids accidentally made a purchase on Amazon or iTunes?) Your design should help correct this, though, because you don’t want to give the user a poor experience. This makes confirmation another one of the essential UX design principles.

* **The user is in control:** User control focuses on greater flexibility of use and better control of where a user is within a design or product, enhancing user experience. Furthermore, it allows users to backpedal and recover from errors.

* **Design with personality:** Your design can attract more users if it showcases a character that interests the user persona you are designing for. Users find it hard to connect with a lifeless design, device, or code.

* **Visual grammar:** Visual grammar has its roots in graphic design, but it sits at the helm of all visual communication, which plays a significant role in user experience. Visual grammar consists of everything that makes up the visual elements of a design: icons, illustrations, patterns, and more.

* **Narrative design:** Another one of the most important user experience design principles is narrative design, or telling a story with your design. Two critical storytelling elements are time and rhythm. Time is the pacing your design adopts—for example, how slowly or quickly your narrative is unveiled.
